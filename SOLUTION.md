# Solution Architecture Overview

## Architecture Overview

The PartsTracker solution is structured as a modern, containerized, multi-tier application:

- **Frontend**: Built with React (located in `src/PartsTracker.UI/partstracker.ui`), providing a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Backend API**: Implemented in .NET (located in `src/PartsTracker.WebApi`), exposing RESTful endpoints for managing parts data.
- **Infrastructure**: Defined using Terraform scripts (`infrastructure/`), enabling reproducible cloud infrastructure provisioning.
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose is used for local development and testing, orchestrating the frontend, backend, and any supporting services (e.g., databases).

## Trade-offs

- **Simplicity vs. Scalability**: The solution uses a monolithic API and a single database for simplicity and ease of development. For larger scale or more complex requirements, a microservices approach or managed database services could be considered.
- **Technology Choices**: React was chosen for rapid UI development and a rich ecosystem. .NET provides a robust, type-safe backend. Docker Compose is used for local orchestration, trading off the complexity of Kubernetes for ease of use in development environments.
- **Portability vs. Cloud-Native**: While Docker Compose ensures local portability, production deployments may benefit from cloud-native orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes, Azure App Service, AWS ECS).

## Security and Monitoring Notes

- **API Security**: All API endpoints should be protected with HTTPS. Input validation and output encoding are enforced to prevent common vulnerabilities. Authentication and authorization (e.g., JWT, OAuth2) are recommended for production.
- **Frontend Security**: User input is sanitized, and dependencies are kept up to date. The frontend communicates with the backend over secure channels (HTTPS).
- **Monitoring**: Application logs and metrics should be collected and monitored. Recommended tools include Application Insights, ELK stack, or Prometheus/Grafana. Alerts should be configured for critical failures or suspicious activity.

## Cost Strategies

- **Containerization**: Using Docker containers allows for efficient resource utilization and easy scaling, reducing infrastructure costs.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform scripts enable reproducible environments and help avoid over-provisioning, keeping costs predictable.
- **Managed Services**: For production, leveraging managed cloud services (e.g., managed databases, serverless compute) can reduce operational overhead and optimize costs.
- **Resource Optimization**: Regularly review resource usage and scale down unused services. Use auto-scaling and reserved instances where appropriate.
